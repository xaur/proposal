# Decred Arabia Communications and Content Creation Proposal

## What?

This proposal is an effort by contributors from Arabic countries to increase the awareness, presence and adoption of Decred Project in the arabic region.

The objective of this proposal is to have a dedicated budget that will cover six months of operations, and that will cover marketing, events, video creation, social media management, user support, community organising and general outreach in arabic.

## Why?

Knowing that the arabic population is over 300 million people, spread across Asia and Africa, this proposal is to set a precedent for funding for a specific region of the world, so that Decred will be known all over the world.

Having seen the usefulness of the blockchain, many Arabic states have invested in the creation of specialized departments or have simply signed partnerships with world leaders in the sector. Many companies (start-ups) have also been created, creating an ecosystem conducive to the emergence of this technology in the Arabic world.

## How?

Since 2017 we've started our adventure with Decred with love and we will continue to do what we have been doing.
